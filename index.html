      <h2>ENIAC - 1946</h2>
      <p>One of the first programmable general-purpose electronic digital
        computers was <b>ENIAC</b>,or <b>Electronic Numerical Integrator and
          Computer</b>. It was built in 1943 in the United States. The Moore School
        of Electrical Engineering received government funding with the goal to
        create an all-electronic computer. It had a specific purpose to compute
        values for artillery range tables. The computer was faster than others
        at the time, but it had to be programmed through a plugboard. ENIAC was
        programmed one problem at a time and had to be changed for other
        problems. Once it was programmed for a certain problem it was incredibly
        fast at giving a solution. Despite having to be programmed for one
        problem, it had the ability to decide the order of execution of the
        instructions, such as if then statements. This ability is called
        <i>conditional branching</i> which at the time of ENIAC only two other
        computers had; Colossus and Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine.

    <div class="IBM">
      <h2>IBM's Personal Computer - 1981</h2>
      <p>The <b>IBM personal computer</b> wasn’t the first one, but it was the
        most advanced one. It was developed in 12 months and went outside the
        standard protocol for developing new technology. The desktop computer
        weighed about 50 pounds was about as small as a typewriter. The project
        was led by Bill Lowe who created a team to try to build a computer that
        would justify widespread use. The goal was to have a computer that
        would be small and fast. The team had two weeks to come up with a
        proposal to present. This project attracted some outside help which was
        a key factor to the quick and successful launch of the computer. The
        development team, which at the beginning consisted of roughly 12 people,
        stuck to strict deadlines.

      <blockquote>"For a month, we met every morning to hash
        out what it was this machine had to do and then in the afternoons
        worked on the morning's decisions. We started to build a prototype to
        take — by the end of the year — to a then little-known company called
        Microsoft." -Dave Bradley
      </blockquote>
      <p>The development team went to outside
        companies for hardware since they didn’t have time to develop and test
        new hardware. The team succeeded in making an affordable personal
        computer that set the standard for desktop computers today.

    <div class="Windows">
      <h2>Microsoft Launches Windows - 1985</h2>
      <p>The first version of Windows,
        called <b>Windows OS</b>, was created by Microsoft to run computers. It
        introduced GUI, or graphical user interface, for IBM PCs. Originally
        advertised as an add-on, it took a page out of Apple Inc’s book and
        created a way for people to view information through “windows” instead
        of written command and text prompts. The user could now navigate
        through files displayed visually and click through them with a mouse.
        As Windows developed, it introduced more functions, such as File
        Manager, Program Manager, and Print manager programs. Windows 95
        introduced networking features and an internet browser called Internet
        Explorer. Windows now has seven different versions of itself, each
        version being better than the last. Windows XP introduced a more
        powerful code base and memory management. Windows 7 was what Windows
        Vista was supposed to be: fast and simple system requirements. Windows 8
        introduced the start screen with the application tiles. Windows 10
        introduced Cortana.

      <h2>The World Wide Web - 1989</h2>
      <p><b>The World Wide Web</b> was created by a British scientist named Tim
        Berners-Lee while working at CERN. It was originally designed as a way
        to quickly share information between scientist all over the world. It
        was meant to combine data networks and hypertext that could be accessed
        by anyone. the proposal pitched the idea as a web of hypertext files
        that could be viewed in browsers. The first website and website server
        were on a NeXT computer. The computer had a label written on it that
        said “This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!” because if the
        computer was turned off the whole internet would go down. You can view
        the first website <a href="http://info.cern.ch/">here</a>. Berners-Lee
        included the ability to edit the pages form the browser which was the
        first web editing capability. The internet could only be accessed by
        NeXT computers at first, but later was developed into a line-mode
        browser which could run on any system. Once the project was released,
        Berners-Lee invited other people to help develop the software. A
        handful of the developers created different browsers for the X-Window
        System.

    <div class="Internet">
      <h2>Broadband Internet - 2000</h2>
      <p>At this point the internet has been around for about 10 years.
        Internet connections came through telephone lines. You couldn’t talk
        and browse the internet at the same time, you had to choose one over
        the other, or get another phone line. The speed was comparable to a
        snail’s as well. Dial connections for phones took a lot longer to
        connect to another line. It could take anywhere from 10 minutes to
        hours just to download a song. It would take days for a movie. It was
        and inconvenience that was mended in the early 2000’s. <b>Broadband
          internet</b> split the signal in lines between phone and internet. This
        meant you could browse the internet and talk to someone at the same
        time, as well as speeding up connection times. Faster internet speeds
        meant faster download times. This led to streaming sites such as
        Netflix and YouTube. It was expensive at first, but now we all use
        broadband internet in some way, such as 4G mobile broadband, which is
        how you can use your phone’s web browser anywhere.
